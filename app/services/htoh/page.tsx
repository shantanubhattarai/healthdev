          Hospital to Home: Safe, Supported Transitions
        </h3>
        <p className="text-zinc-800">
          At Apex Aid Health Care, we understand that leaving hospital is a
          critical time that requires careful planning and the right support.
          Our Hospital to Home transition service is designed to help
          individuals with disability, illness, or injury move safely and
          confidently from hospital or rehabilitation settings back into their
          homes or supported living environments.
