          disabilities. That is why we offer Specialist Disability Accommodation

          What makes SDA different?
        </h3>
        <div className="text-zinc-700">
          SDA properties are not ordinary homes. They are designed in accordance
          with NDIS requirements and include a range of features such as:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
            <li>Custom accessibility layouts</li>
            <li>Advance assistive technologies</li>
            <li>Safety modifications</li>
            <li>Durable, low maintenance materials</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p className="text-zinc-700 mt-2">
          SDA also works in tandem with your other funded supports, such as
          <span className="font-medium">
            &nbsp;Supported Independent Living (SIL),&nbsp;
          </span>
          allowing you to access care services while living in a space that
          suits your needs.
